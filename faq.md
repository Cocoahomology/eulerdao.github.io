# How did *EularDAO* start?

*EularDAO* is inspired by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and members have generally taken pride in showing their achievements.

It would be interesting to issue [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)s for solution providers because the [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)s represents the intelligence, skills and hard work.

On-chain competiton is fair, auditable and transparent and it is a way to share the achievements on mathematics, algorithms and coding skills and protect the copyright of the authors.

# Can I sell my [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)? 

Sure!

Your solution will belong to the buyer once you sell it.

# Can I plagiarize?

Yes.

Submitted solutions are public to everyone. The compiled solutions are all fetchable but not their source code if their authors didn't published the source code.

Exactly same solutions can not be submmit twice because the hash of the compiled code is locked once submitted. Of course you can modify the solution a bit or just append some meaningless code to it and then submit it successfully.

Actually the winner of a competiton is lowest gas usage solution and if the gas usages are same, the earlest one will be chosen.

Thus if other users plagiarize your solution, you are still earlier than them.

Also two-step submitting mechnism is used to avoid plagiarism and [MEV](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research).

# What can I do if the problem makes a mistake?

Submit an issue on [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems) and provide the test case. Better to provide additional code in any language to prove your test case.

# Can I view other solutions before I solve the problem?

Sure but you may lose the pleasure of solving problems!

Submitted solutions are public to everyone and we are not willing or able to hide them.

# Where is my solution stored?

Solutions are recorded on blockchain, and if you use [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) mainnet, your solutions may never been lost.

# Can I submit problems?

Sure and welcome!

If you have a wonderful idea, welcome to submit issues or pull requests on [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems). DAO members will decide the acceptments.

# Is there a forum for discussion?

Forum is not provided but you can still discuss under the issue of [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems) and submit your solutions on [Solutions](https://github.com/EulerDAO/solutions) or verify your solution contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

# How can I contact *EularDAO*?

Just submit issues on [Github](https://github.com/EulerDAO).

# Who are the maintainers?

*EulerDAO* is developed and maintained by real-named and anonymous volunteers including talented mathematicians, researchers and programmers.

# Can I invest in *EularDAO*?

No.

*EulerDAO* is a non-profit project and any donations are gratefully received.
