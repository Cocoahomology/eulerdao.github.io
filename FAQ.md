# How did *EularDAO* start?

*EularDAO* is inspired by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and it would be interesting to issue [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)s for solution providers because the [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)s represents the intelligence, skills and hard work. On-chain competiton is fair, auditable and transparent and it is a way to share the achievements on mathematics, algorithms and coding skills and protect the copyright of the authors.

# Can I sell my [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)s? 

Sure and your solutions will belong to other one once you sell them.

# Can I plagiarize other solutions?

Yes but same solution can not be submmit twice on *EularDAO* (its hash is locked once submitted). Of course You can modify a bit or just append some meaningless code and them submit them successfully, but this solution is not better and it is a later solution. Actually the winner of a competiton is lowest gas usage solution (and if the gas usages are same, the earlest one will be chosen).

# Can other users plagiarize my solution?

Yes but you are still the winner if you are the best one. The winner of a competiton is lowest gas usage solution (and if the gas usages are same, the earlest one will be chosen). Two-step submitting is used because *EulerDAO* want to avoid plagiarism and [MEV](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research).

# What can I do if the problem makes a mistake?

Submit an issue of that on [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems) and provide the case. Better to provide additional code in any language to prove your case.

# Can I view other solutions before I solve the problem?

Sure but you will lose the pleasure of solving problems! You are able to see other solutions submitted at any time. *EulerDAO* doesn't want to hide them on purpose. Users whose purpose is education nd training should be self-disciplined and users whose purpose is finding answers can get them quickly.

# Can my solutions disappear?

If your solutions are submitted on [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) mainnet, the blockchain will remember your solution forever.

# Can I submit problems?

Sure! If you have a wonderful idea, welcome to submit issues or pull requests on [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems). DAO members will decide the acceptments.

# Is there a forum for discussion?

Forum is not provided but you can still discuss under the issue of [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems) and submit your solutions on [Solutions](https://github.com/EulerDAO/solutions) or verify your solution contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).
